Coin0008I MODEL read with 0 errors
Option for timeMode changed from cpu to elapsed
Continuous objective value is 3 - 0.00 seconds
Cgl0003I 4 fixed, 3 tightened bounds, 4 strengthened rows, 0 substitutions
Cgl0004I processed model has 25 rows, 13 columns (8 integer (3 of which binary)) and 66 elements
Cutoff increment increased from 1e-05 to 0.9999
Cbc0038I Initial state - 0 integers unsatisfied sum - 1.74623e-10
Cbc0038I Solution found of 3
Cbc0038I Relaxing continuous gives 3
Cbc0038I Cleaned solution of 3
Cbc0038I Before mini branch and bound, 8 integers at bound fixed and 3 continuous of which 2 were internal integer and 0 internal continuous
