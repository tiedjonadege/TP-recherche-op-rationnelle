Problem MODEL has 10 rows, 15 columns and 29 elements
Coin0008I MODEL read with 0 errors
Option for timeMode changed from cpu to elapsed
Continuous objective value is 250 - 0.00 seconds
Cgl0004I processed model has 6 rows, 9 columns (9 integer (9 of which binary)) and 15 elements
Cutoff increment increased from 1e-05 to 49.9999
Cbc0038I Initial state - 0 integers unsatisfied sum - 0
Cbc0038I Solution found of 250
Cbc0038I Before mini branch and bound, 9 integers at bound fixed and 0 continuous
Cbc0038I Mini branch and bound did not improve solution (0.00 seconds)
Cbc0038I After 0.00 seconds - Feasibility pump exiting with objective of 250 - took 0.00 seconds
Cbc0012I Integer solution of 250 found by feasibility pump after 0 iterations and 0 nodes (0.00 seconds)
Cbc0001I Search completed - best objective 250, took 0 iterations and 0 nodes (0.00 seconds)
Cbc0035I Maximum depth 0, 0 variables fixed on reduced cost
Cuts at root node changed objective from 250 to 250
Probing was tried 0 times and created 0 cuts of which 0 were active after adding rounds of cuts (0.000 seconds)
